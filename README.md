# AES-File-Encryption

The File Encryption System using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Java is a security application designed to protect sensitive data by encrypting files using the AES encryption algorithm. AES is a widely used and robust encryption technique known for its security and efficiency.

Key features of the File Encryption System include:

AES Encryption: The system utilizes the AES encryption algorithm to convert plain-text files into ciphertext, making it challenging for unauthorized users to decipher the original data.

File Selection: Users can select specific files or directories that they want to encrypt, ensuring that only the designated files are protected.

Key Generation: The system generates a secure encryption key that is used to encrypt the files. The key is kept confidential and plays a crucial role in decrypting the files later.

Secure Encryption Process: The AES encryption process is carried out with high security standards, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to break the encryption and access the original data without the proper key.

Decryption Capability: Users can also decrypt the encrypted files back to their original form using the correct encryption key and password.

Overall, the File Encryption System using AES in Java provides a robust and reliable way to safeguard sensitive files from unauthorized access. By employing AES encryption, users can have confidence in the security of their data, ensuring that confidential information remains protected even if the files fall into the wrong hands.
